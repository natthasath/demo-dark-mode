                <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
                <p>
                    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on
                    the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped
                    into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
                    conversations in it, ‚Äúand what is the use of a book,‚Äù thought Alice
                    ‚Äúwithout pictures or conversations?‚Äù
                </p>
                <p>
                    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for
                    the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the
                    pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of
                    getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit
                    with pink eyes ran close by her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
                    so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‚ÄúOh
                    dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!‚Äù (when she thought it over
                    afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at
                    this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the
                    Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked
                    at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it
                    flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with
                    either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning
                    with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately
                    was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the
                    hedge.

                <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
                <p>
                    I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most
                    distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years
                    counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public
                    situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who
                    knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public
                    business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the
                    affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his
                    marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became
                    a husband and the father of a family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I
                    cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends
                    was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous
                    mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of
                    a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in
                    poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been
                    distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,
                    therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his
                    daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in
                    wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship
                    and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate
                    circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his
                    friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united
                    them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope
                    of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and
                    assistance.
